# Rebuild
I'm excited to share my latest experience with a knowledgeable hacker I've been in contact with. My distant friend helped me while tryingto improve my credit rating to buy My Saloon location. My credit was so low (483) and I had about 5 different credit cards that hadbeen charged in the lasttwo months. I needed to remove the accounts from my credit report,but the problem was that they are the oldest cards on my report. I contacted ROOTKITS CREDIT SPECIALIST to help me rebuild my credit, remove negatives and increasemy score; they also helped me clear some of the debt on my account.They did exactly that for me in less than 8 days and I just bought a house after that. Here are the contact details: ROOTKITSCREDITSPECIALIST @ GMAIL . COM or  815  5248116.
